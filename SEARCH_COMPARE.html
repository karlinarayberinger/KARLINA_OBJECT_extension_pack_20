<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++</a> program featured in this tutorial web page implements six different searching algorithms which each (a) return the index of the first array element of a one-dimensional array of nonnegative integers which matches some target nonnegative integer value or else (b) return negative one to indicate that the target value was not found in the array. The program user inputs exactly four values: N (which is the total number of elements to include in the array), T (which is the total number of unique nonnegative integer values which each element of the array can be instantiated as exactly one of per program runtime instance), x (which is the target nonnegative integer value to search for in the array), and c (which is the nonnegative integer corresponding with a particular choice of searching algorithm to use).</span></p>

<p><em><strong>For search algorithms which sort the array named A before proceeding to search for the array element in A whose value is x, the returned array element index of the found element (i.e. whose stored value is x) is an array index in A after A is sorted rather than an array index in A before it was sorted.</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/search_compare.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>search_compare.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ search_compare.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, N, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of elements to store in the array named A):</pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for N using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: After a value for N is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a nonnegative integer, T, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of states each element of A can represent exactly one of per instance):</pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: After a value for T is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a nonnegative integer value, x, which is no larger than 100000 to search for in the array named A:</pre>
<p>STEP_10: Enter a value for x using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_11: After a value for x is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>SEARCH ALGORITHMS:

0: LINEAR_SEARCH
1: BINARY_SEARCH
2: TERNARY_SEARCH
3: FIBONACCI_SEARCH
4: EXPONENTIAL_SEARCH
5: JUMP_SEARCH

Enter either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to store in the variable named c and which represents one of the above search algorithm choices to implement (to return the first instance of x in A and to determine how long that takes in seconds):</pre>
<p>STEP_12: Enter a value for c using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_13: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/search_compare_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

Start Of Program
--------------------------------

Enter a natural number, N, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of elements to store in the array named A): 

The value which was entered for N is 1000.

Enter a nonnegative integer, T, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of states each element of A can represent exactly one of per instance): 

The value which was entered for T is 500.

SEARCH ALGORITHMS:

0: LINEAR_SEARCH

2: TERNARY_SEARCH
3: FIBONACCI_SEARCH

5: JUMP_SEARCH

Enter either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to store in the variable named c and which represents one of the above search algorithm choices to implement (to return the first instance of x in A and to determine how long that takes in seconds): 

The value which was entered for c is 3.
